# B&B I Bastioni (IT)
Hi there, that's my project about B&B I Bastioni located in the wonderful town of Alghero, in Sardinia.
His phantom owner Paolo Marras wanted to post it on the web to gain more visibility and make more sales! 
### The technologies that I used are:
* HTML
* CSS with preprocessor SASS
* Javascript
* React (with React Router)
### How to start the project
Start it as every React project so, with npm start!
### How it Works
At the start you will be redirected at the homepage. You can navigate with the navbar above, it will redirect you in three sections:
* Section AboutMe, It talks about the story about Paolo Marras and how and why he created the B&B.
* Section History of the City, Paolo is very passionate about history. He wanted a recap of the story about his hometown, so we did it!
* Section Rates, you can visit and see the rooms and their rates and ask a quote with the form of the page!
If you stay in the HomePage you can see the rooms and important infos aboutt the B&B, as offered services e and awards won!
